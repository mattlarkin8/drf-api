## **Project: Django REST Framework / Docker**

### Author: Matthew Larkin

### Setup

Ensure you have properly setup your `venv`. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  

Use `python manage.py runserver` to test the site deployment on your local machine.  

If you have docker, use `docker-compose up --build` to build and deploy a Docker deployment of the Django app.

### Tests

Testing uses the built-in django testing framework.

Run the tests with `python manage.py test`.
